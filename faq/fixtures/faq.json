    "question": "What is the burning time of the candles?",
    "answer": "Each candle is designed to burn for approximately 70 hours. While the wax amount could allow for a longer burn, we account for the unburnable portion at the bottom of the jar for safety—typically around 2–3 cm of wax will remain. This ensures the jar never overheats or becomes unsafe to use."

    "question": "Can the candle jar be re-used?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! Our candle jars are designed to be repurposed. Once the wax is finished, simply remove any remaining wax with a spoon or paper towel, then clean the jar gently with warm soapy water or vinegar (take care around the label). The elegant vessel makes a great diffuser container, or you can use it as a vase, a bathroom organizer, or even a cold beverage glass. We don’t recommend using it for hot drinks."

    "question": "Why are there small bubbles in the wax near the glass?",
    "answer": "Tiny air bubbles may appear near the glass as the candle cools—this happens naturally during the hand-pouring process. It’s purely cosmetic and doesn’t affect the performance or burn quality of the candle."
